## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express, Node.js, Tailwind (with DaisyUI)

**Important:** You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. Both [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/docs/install/) have already been configured in the app, but I recommend checking out the documentation if you're new to using CSS frameworks.

I wanted this to be a basic, fast-loading app. So I bootstrapped it with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The second thing to decide was the styling. Tailwind is a very popular option, so I went with DaisyUI because of the basic and elegant components it offers. For the back-end, nothing fancy, just Node.
